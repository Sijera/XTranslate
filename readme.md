==========
A new life of popular extension for Opera browser, now for the Chrome!

Old version and testimonials are [here](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/xtranslate/).

What it does?
-----------
Easy translate a text on pages in the context of web-site that you reading. Don't loose the focus by switching to translate.google.com or other service. Get the translation right here, right now! Double click or select a word/sentence and you've got translation.

Even more, by using a hotkey (**ctrl+shift+x** by default), you can obtain text translation from web-links, buttons, text inside the textarea and from the images ("alt" or "title" attribute will be used). 
Just mouse over the element and press hotkey!

Out of the box it supports three translation vendors:

You can choose your favorite!

Help the project
-----------
The extension is open-source and free, so if someone can do something from the list below, I will be appreciate:
* Draw a nice icons (128x128, 48x48, 16x16?)
* Translate the extension UI in different languages

Check [the link](https://github.com/ixrock/XTranslate/tree/master/_locales) to get to know which languages are absent or, maybe, you can suggest any fixes in other locales.

Peace!
